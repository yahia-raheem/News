    Now, Mubarak loses more than he gains from the profession he loves. With visible frustration, he tells Muwatin:
    “Sometimes a single fishing trip costs me 1,000 riyals (275 USD)—spent on fuel for the boat, wages for the crew, and
    other expenses. But the fish I manage to catch sells for just 800 riyals (220 USD). The profits are so slim that on
    some days, I walk away with nothing at all.”
