        The study highlights that multi-stage flash (MSF) distillation technology is highly energy-intensive, primarily
        due to the thermal energy required for the distillation process. This significant energy demand contributes to
        greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which has both short- and long-term negative
        impacts on human health and the environment. For instance, MSF plants can emit millions of tons of CO₂ annually.
        The study notes that in 2014, MSF desalination plants in Qatar released 4.66 million tons of CO₂.
