    Desalination plants using multi-stage flash (MSF) or distillation technology, with a combined capacity of 504
    million gallons per day, could have a climatic impact that hinders Qatar’s ability to meet its climate action plans
    and nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

    A 2019 study titled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0011916418314942">“Examining the
        life-cycle environmental impacts of desalination: A case study in the State of Qatar”</a>highlights that MSF
    desalination plants emit between 7.32 kg and 12.6 kg of CO₂ per cubic meter of water produced, depending on the
    plant’s efficiency index.
