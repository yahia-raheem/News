            Houl” Power Plant</a>is a joint venture, with 60% owned by Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), 30%
        by the foreign company K1, and the remaining 10% shared among a consortium of Japanese investors: Mitsubishi
        (20%), JERA (10%), Qatar Foundation (5%), and QatarEnergy (formerly Qatar Petroleum, 5%).
        <span>In contrast, “Ras Abu Fontas” plant is wholly owned by QEWC.</span>

    <p class="bottom animate fade-in">Although the “Ras Abu Fontas” and “Umm Al Houl” desalination plants are close to
        each other and discharge their brine into the same area, their environmental impacts differ significantly. Dr.
        Radwan Ben Hamadou, a professor of marine ecology at Qatar University, explains in an interview with Muwatin
        that this difference is primarily due to the methods of brine discharge employed by each plant.</p>
