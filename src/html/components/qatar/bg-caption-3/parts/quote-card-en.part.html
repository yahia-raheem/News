        Dr. Jenny Lawler believes that Qatar's current thermal desalination plants contribute minimally to greenhouse
        gas emissions. This is because the heat used in thermal desalination is a byproduct of electricity generation,
        produced by burning gas in the country’s power turbines. “Until electricity is generated using renewable energy
        sources, it makes sense to view desalinated water as a secondary product derived from power generation,” she
        says.

        However, she adds that thermal desalination plants discharge brine at higher temperatures and with more
        chemicals than seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants. For this reason, Qatar’s strategy is to shift away from
        thermal desalination and adopt reverse osmosis technology.
