                Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs),
                explains: “The challenge of desalination in the Gulf lies in its integration with power generation.
                Excess heat from fossil fuel-powered electricity generation is used to operate thermal desalination
                plants, particularly during summer.”

                Speaking to Muwatin, Elgendy adds: “If fossil fuel power plants were replaced with renewable energy
                plants, desalination plants reliant on excess heat would also need to be replaced with technologies that
                don’t depend on this heat, significantly increasing the cost of energy transition.”
