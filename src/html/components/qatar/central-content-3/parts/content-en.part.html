    The researcher attributed this to the plant’s offshore discharge point, where brine is rapidly diluted by
    surrounding seawater. The further the brine travels from the discharge point, the more diluted it becomes.

    This dilution lowers the concentration of potentially harmful substances in the brine, reducing its impact on marine
    life. The study found no clear correlation between microbial diversity and proximity to the discharge outlet,
    indicating effective dilution.

    Dr. Radwan, one of the study’s supervisors, notes: “The comparison between Ras Abu Fontas and Umm Al Houl is crucial
    because both plants affect the same seagrass, shellfish, coral reefs, and mangroves. However, the impact is vastly
    different. At Ras Abu Fontas, brine is discharged without diffusers or tidal synchronization, making the damage to
    marine life evident to everyone.”

    Dr. Jenny Lawler, Senior Research Director at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute, acknowledges in
    an interview with Muwatin that there are few field studies on the environmental impact of desalination plants in
    Qatar. She attributes this partly to the difficulty of isolating desalination impacts from the numerous other
    stressors affecting the Gulf, such as climate change, oil and gas operations, commercial fishing, shipping, and
    construction. However, she notes that other studies have shown that desalination plant discharge can cause coral
    bleaching and death.

    “Brine typically sinks in the water column and can lead to oxygen depletion in deeper layers, negatively impacting
    sediment-level marine life,” Lawler adds.
</p>

<p class="prefix animate fade-in">According to the paper “The Risks of Mega-Construction: Sustainability of Desalination
    and Brine Regulation in the Arabian Gulf,” Qatar accounts for 2% of global desalination capacity but is responsible
    for 5% of global brine production.
