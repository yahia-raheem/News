        According to Dr. Radwan, Qatar’s oldest desalination plant, “Ras Abu Fontas,” discharges brine directly onto the
        shore through a single outlet, amplifying its impact on marine life. In contrast, the “Umm Al Houl” plant
        discharges brine 2.6 kilometers offshore through multiple outlets. This approach significantly mitigates the
        impact of brine due to higher dilution rates and the large volume of water into which the brine is released.

        Dr. Radwan elaborates: “What we cannot change is the amount of salt added to the Gulf every year. The quantity
        remains the same, whether or not dilution is aided by diffusers.”

        A 2022 thesis by researcher Huda Al-Husseini, titled “Assessing the Impact of Brine Discharge from Desalination
        Plants on Marine Microbial Biodiversity in Qatar,” remains the only scientific study to date focused on a Qatari
        desalination plant as a case study. The research examined the physical and chemical properties of seawater
        receiving brine discharge from the Umm Al Houl plant and found no significant changes. Parameters like
        temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen stayed within acceptable ranges for marine environments.
