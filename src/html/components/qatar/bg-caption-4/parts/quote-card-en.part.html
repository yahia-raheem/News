        Legal Gap
    </h5>
    <p>
        According to the study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212371724000210#bib53">“The
            perils of building big: Desalination sustainability and brine regulation in the Arab Gulf countries,”</a>
        Qatar currently lacks specific standards for managing brine discharge. The broader Gulf region faces similar
        challenges, with fragmented environmental regulations and legal uncertainties.

    </p>
    <p>
        The study points out that none of the GCC countries have established comprehensive environmental monitoring
        plans, which are essential components of desalination-related environmental regulations. It emphasizes the need
        for such plans to address key issues, including site selection, mitigation of environmental impacts during
        construction, monitoring procedures, and emergency measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Qatar’s Law No. 30 of 2002, which outlines environmental protection rules across more than 80 articles, does not
        specifically address the brine discharge issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Article 42 mentions protecting the environment from pollution by implementing “preventive and precautionary
        approaches to safeguard the state’s coasts and ports from all types and sources of pollution risks” and
        “minimize potential impacts to the lowest possible levels.” Additionally, Article 55 references Decree No. 55 of
        1992 regarding the Protocol for Marine Environment Protection from Land-Based Sources, which covers liquid waste
        discharged into the marine environment, although it does not explicitly mention brine.
