    Karim Elgendy categorizes the environmental impacts of desalination into two key areas: the emissions generated by
    desalination processes, which largely rely on fossil fuels, and the highly saline brine discharged into the Gulf.
    Both are examples of the tragedy of the commons, where no single entity bears the environmental costs of increased
    carbon concentration or rising salinity levels in the Gulf.

<p class="animate fade-in">
    He also highlights that brine discharge is a significant problem because the Gulf’s waters are already highly
    saline. Additionally, it takes 5 to 7 years for Gulf waters to be replaced by fresh inflow from the Indian Ocean.

    Lawler believes that advances in emerging thermal and membrane desalination technologies, the movement toward
    zero-liquid discharge, and the utilization of brine could transform Qatar's water sector’s environmental and
    economic landscape. Currently, only 40% of seawater is recovered as freshwater, with the remainder discharged as
    waste. Implementing such methods requires significant changes to the economic framework and creating pathways for
    adopting new technologies. Transitioning to renewable energy sources also demands systemic changes in how
    desalination plants are operated.
</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Research institutions in Qatar are actively working to mitigate the negative impacts of brine, Lawler notes. The
    Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) and Qatar University are developing thermoplastic materials
    that can be used in desalination plants to reduce the reliance on anti-scaling chemicals, thereby decreasing the
    chemical content of discharged brine. Qatar University is also working on advancing thermal desalination
    technologies, although these initiatives are still in the research phase and need implementation.
