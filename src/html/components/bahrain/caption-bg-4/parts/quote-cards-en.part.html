    Dr. Al-Daoud adds, “The same applies to extreme temperatures. Marine organisms cannot regulate their body
    temperatures, leading to their death. While some species with wider tolerance ranges can endure elevated
    temperatures and salinity to some extent, they are still affected. Their growth and reproduction rates are no longer
    normal.”

    Jawad Al-Qallaf, a Bahraini fisherman in his 50s, has noticed a decline in fish growth rates. He says, “The
    ‘Sobaiti’ fish is now small in size and almost extinct; we can no longer catch it easily. Similarly, the ‘Shaari’
    fish has shrunk and become harder to catch because it has moved to deeper waters.”

    Speaking to Muwatin, Al-Qallaf continues, “The Hamour fish has also changed; it’s smaller than what we used to catch
    in the past, even though it’s still abundant. I’ve also noticed a scarcity of other species, like the ‘Qarqofan’ and
    ‘Baddah’ fish. As for the ‘Safat’ fish, it has become rare and is often scrawny. Sometimes, I throw it back into the
    water. The ‘Faskar’ fish has completely disappeared from our waters.”

    Dr. Al-Daoud describes the actions of the Al Dur plant as selfish: “The plant draws water from a distance of 1.5
    kilometers (about one mile) to maintain its efficiency, but it discharges the brine directly onto the coast, without
    concern for marine life, its death, or the alteration of the water’s hydraulic properties.”
