    Bahrainâ€™s territorial waters are home to diverse sensitive marine habitats, including seagrass beds, coral reefs,
    mangroves, and intertidal mudflats. These ecosystems play a crucial role in supporting marine biodiversity. They
    serve as nurseries, breeding grounds, and feeding areas for numerous fish species and large endangered animals, such
    as dugongs, dolphins, and green turtles.
