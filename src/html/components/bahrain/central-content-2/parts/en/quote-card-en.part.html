        In Bahrain, where salinity gradient standards are absent, the study compared its findings with the quality
        standards set by Kuwaitâ€™s Environmental Public Authority for cooling water discharge into marine areas. The
        comparison showed that salinity levels at most sampling sites exceeded the permissible wastewater discharge
        standards by an average of 2.5%- 9.0%.
