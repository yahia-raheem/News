    Dr. Thamer Al-Daoud, a professor of marine biology in the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at the
    Arabian Gulf University, explains the impact of salinity in his interview with Muwatin. He says, “The effects of
    excessive salinity on marine organisms are often physiological. Coastal species are adapted to a process known as
    ‘osmoregulation,’ where marine organisms match the salt concentration inside their bodies to the salt concentration
    outside. Under normal conditions, marine creatures can regulate osmosis. However, in cases of extreme salinity,
    these organisms either migrate to distant areas or die because they cannot withstand the stress.”
