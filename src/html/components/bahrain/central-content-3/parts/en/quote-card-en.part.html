    <h5>Osmoregulation:</h5>
    <p>Osmoregulation is the active process by which living organisms maintain the balance of water and dissolved
        substances within their body fluids to achieve internal equilibrium. This involves regulating osmotic pressure,
        which refers to the tendency of water to move across a semi-permeable membrane due to differences in solute
        concentrations. The primary goal of osmoregulation is to ensure that the internal environment remains stable
        despite changes in external conditions.</p>
