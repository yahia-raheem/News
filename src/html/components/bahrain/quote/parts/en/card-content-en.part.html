    He describes the transformation to Muwatin: “At first, we saw pipes pumping water into the sea. They told us it was
    for desalinating Gulf water to make it suitable for drinking, farming, and other uses. But things escalated. The
    Gulf’s waters changed color, and its smell became unbearable. It turned yellow. The fish we relied on for our
    livelihood fled these waters.”

    He adds, “When we noticed the changes in the water, we raised the issue with officials, who assured us it was a
    temporary problem that would be resolved quickly. But today, the damage has reached every Bahraini coastline. Fish,
    which are both a key source of food security for Bahrain’s population and a vital part of our local culture, are now
    almost nonexistent. Our fisheries cannot compare to those of other Gulf or Arab countries anymore.”
