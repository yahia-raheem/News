    For 64 of his nearly 80 years, Bahraini fisherman Sayed Jaafar Al-Bladi worked the waters of the Arabian Gulf. This
    work was a lifeline for him, his children, and his grandchildren. However, changes in these waters have forced him
    to abandon the only livelihood he has ever known.

    Al-Bladi, like more than half of Bahrain’s population, lives on the shores of the Arabian Gulf. He knows its waters
    as intimately as he knows himself. “In the late 1980s, the sea began to change because of the construction of
    desalination plants,” he says.
