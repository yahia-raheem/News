    <p>Experts and researchers interviewed by Muwatin and published scientific studies point to the “Al Dur 1” and “Al
        Dur 2” plants as contributors to increased salinity in Bahrain’s waters in the Arabian Gulf. The discharge of
        brine into shallow depths has negatively impacted benthic (seafloor) animals, seagrass beds, and, consequently,
        the livelihoods of local fishermen in the area.</p>
