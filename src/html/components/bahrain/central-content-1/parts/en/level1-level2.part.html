                The “Al Dur 1” desalination plant is located on Bahrain’s southeastern coast and officially entered full
                operation in February 2012 to meet the growing demand for drinking water and electricity. It has a daily
                capacity of 218,000 cubic meters (58 million gallons) were developed as a Build-Own-Operate (BOO)
                project with private sector participation.

                In March 2019, seven years after “Al Dur 1” began operations, an agreement was signed to launch a new
                plant, “Al Dur 2.” Spanning over 192,000 square meters, the new facility was designed to generate 1,500
                megawatts of power using combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technology and to desalinate 58 million
                gallons of seawater daily through reverse osmosis—a technology also employed by “Al Dur 1.” The plant
                entered full operation in the second quarter of 2022.
