<p>A 2019 <a href="https://wstagcc.org/WSTA-13th-Gulf-Water-Conference/WSTA-13-Gulf-Water-Conference-Proceedings%20.pdf"
        target="_blank">study</a> titled “Effect of brine discharge from Al-Dur RO [Reverse Osmosis] desalination plant
    on the infauna species composition in the East Coast of Bahrain” revealed that brine discharge from the “Al Dur”
    desalination plant has created harsh environmental conditions.
</p>
<p>The researchers collected water samples from ten locations, varying in distance from the plant’s discharge outlet and
    at depths ranging from less than one meter to seven meters. They measured salinity and tidal movements, finding that
    water salinity exceeded 55% near the plant’s discharge point. This is significantly higher than the natural seawater
    salinity of about 35%, posing a severe threat to local Fmarine ecosystems. Additionally, water temperatures near the
    discharge site exceeded 38°C (100.4°F), particularly during summer, indicating a notable thermal impact.
</p>
<p>The study also documented a decline in biodiversity and the abundance of benthic (seafloor) microfaunal communities
    in areas adjacent to the desalination plant’s discharge point. Fish mortality and the disappearance of benthic
    marine species, such as echinoderms, were observed around the plant. These effects were attributed to slow growth
    rates, failures in osmoregulatory mechanisms, cell shrinkage, and endocrine dysfunction.
