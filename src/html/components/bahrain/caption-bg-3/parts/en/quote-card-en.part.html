        Al-Bladi corroborates this: “Many fish that were once abundant and even exported from Bahrain have disappeared.
        One example is the ‘mied’ fish, plentiful until 2002. It was so abundant that children could catch it along the
        shores. Back then, its price didn’t exceed half a dinar per kilogram because it was easy to catch, as it swam
        near the surface, unlike other species that required diving. Now, it’s gone. Another species, ‘Safi,’
        susceptible to salinity, has also vanished. The salts' influx killed it or forced it to migrate.”

        In the past, Al-Bladi used to catch around 40 kilograms of fish daily. Now, his nets rarely yield more than
        three kilograms—insufficient to support a family. This decline is due to the disappearance of many fish species,
        such as ‘Bass,’ ‘Zmaroor,’ ‘Hamour,’ and ‘Baddah.’
