    <h5>Seagrass beds:</h5>
    <p>
        Seagrass beds are located near the coast of Al Dur, close to the desalination plant, and extend to the Hawar
        Islands. These habitats are vital for various marine species, providing food and shelter for fish, mollusks, and
        endangered species such as dugongs and green turtles.
        Seagrass systems are highly productive and contribute significantly to the marine food web by supporting many
        economically important organisms.
