<p class="animate fade-in">Abdulhussein Hassan, a diver in his 50s, has witnessed the changes happening on the seabed
    for decades. He began his career in the early 1980s when he was just 12 years old. Over the past four decades,
    Hassan has observed how the waters of the Arabian Gulf—where he has dived extensively—have deteriorated due to
    desalination plants.</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    “Desalination plants have significantly increased the salinity of the sea, not just in Bahrain but across the Gulf,”
    says Hassan. “Bahrain might be less affected compared to Kuwait, where I worked for many years, but the salinity
    keeps rising day by day. In the past, our ancestors could swim without any harm to their bodies. Today, simply
    entering the water without specialized swimming or diving goggles irritates the eyes and damages the skin.”

    Hassan recalls seeing hundreds of coral reefs stretching as far as the eye could see, with various colors and
    shapes. Today, however, none remain. “One of the most affected coral species in Bahrain is ‘Arshan,’ which grows
    like a tree and is known for its slow growth,” Hassan tells Muwatin. “There are also stony corals that resemble the
    shape of a human brain, which have been heavily damaged.”

    Hassan’s observation about the coral reefs is supported by a 2022 <a
        href="https://wstagcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vol_263_-Conference-Proceedings.pdf"
        target="_blank">study</a> titled “Characterization of the water mass dynamic changes surrounding a seawater
    reverse osmosis desalination plant on the east coast of the Kingdom of Bahrain.” The study highlights that the Al
    Dur desalination plant, with its highly saline brine discharge, is situated next to a seagrass habitat stretching
    from eastern Bahrain through Fasht Al Adm to the Hawar Islands. It notes that seagrass growth decreases at
    temperatures above 37°C (98.6°F), with prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) being lethal. This
    suggests that brine discharge zones are likely inhospitable environments for seagrass during the summer months.

    Environmental impact assessments further indicate that salinity levels above 58% hinder seagrass growth in the
    Arabian Gulf, while levels exceeding 67% render the area unsuitable for any seagrass species. The study also
    reported extreme salinity levels near the discharge points, with a tendency for high concentrations at the seabed,
    potentially stunting the growth of associated seagrass.

    Dr. Samer Al-Daoud explains the interconnected relationship between seagrass, coral reefs, and mangroves: “If the
    balance of one is disturbed, it affects the others. Mangroves act as a barrier against storms from the land,
    protecting the coastal environment. Seagrass stabilizes the seabed, and if that balance shifts, sediment will
    settle, impacting coral reefs.” He adds, “Seagrass is the most sensitive to salinity and temperature, making it the
    most affected by desalination plants.”

    According to a 2022 <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359106240_Assessing_the_spatiotemporal_changes_associated_carbon_stock_and_potential_emissions_of_mangroves_in_Bahrain_using_GIS_and_remote_sensing_data"
        target="_blank">study</a>, Bahrain lost over 95% of its natural mangrove cover between 1967 and 2020, shrinking
    from 328 hectares to just 48 hectares due to urban development and rising sea temperatures.

    Defending desalination technology, Dr. Waleed Zubari states, “It is essential because Gulf countries are located in
    an arid region, and with growing populations, water must be provided. Access to water is a human right.
    Environmental impacts are often very localized, and new plants are designed to discharge brine at greater depths to
    mitigate their ecological effects.”
