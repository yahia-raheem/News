    Dr. Waleed Zubari, a professor of water resource management at the Arabian Gulf University, chair of the Scientific
    Committee of the Water Science and Technology Association, and supervisor of the study above, tells Muwatin: “The
    Arabian Gulf is shallow, with a depth of no more than 10 meters, and it is a closed, not open, water body. This
    makes it highly susceptible to salinity caused by desalination plants.” Zubari confirms that they identified hot
    spots heavily affected by salinity within a 200-300-meter radius around the plant.

    He adds, “There is a delicate food chain. We studied the micro-benthic communities and found them missing in areas
    where brine is discharged. These micro-communities are essential because larger fish feed on them. Without them, the
    larger fish will also disappear. This was confirmed when we spoke to fishermen working in the area.”

    Al-Daoud and Zubari agree that the decline in fish stocks cannot be attributed solely to the salinity and heat
    caused by desalination plants. They emphasize that the causes are interconnected and complex, stemming from various
    pollution sources in the Arabian Gulf, such as oil spills, chemical factory emissions, overfishing, and other
    factors.
