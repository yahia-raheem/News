        <p class="dead-sea-revival-para">Carlos Duarte notes that adding brine, with a salinity level of 250 grams of
            salt per liter of water, could help replenish the Dead Sea’s volume. The elevation difference would allow
            gravity to transport brine effectively. While geopolitical challenges complicate such a solution, Duarte
            highlights its technical feasibility and potential benefits.

    Duarte adds, “Other solutions focus on extracting valuable minerals from brine, including gold, silver, and lithium.
    KAUST is advancing lithium extraction technologies, which could hold significant economic value given the rising
    demand for electric vehicle batteries. However, such initiatives address only a fraction of the total brine
    production.”

            Carlos Duarte explains: “The primary goal of desalination is to obtain freshwater as the main product.
            Seawater extracted in the Arabian Peninsula contains about 40 grams of salts per liter, while discharged
            brine concentrations range between 70 and 80 grams per liter. This means that for every liter of seawater
            pumped, 960 grams of desalinated water and the discharged brine contain 920 grams. Accordingly, only 40
            grams of freshwater are extracted from every liter of seawater.”

    He adds: “If all the salts in seawater could be utilized, it would allow the extraction of all the freshwater
    associated with them. This would reduce the volume of seawater that needs to be pumped and mitigate the risks of
    returning brine to the ocean.”

    Duarte emphasizes that researching ways to use brine as a raw resource would bring significant benefits, especially
    for Gulf countries, which produce more than half of the world’s desalinated water. This poses a significant
    challenge in terms of energy consumption in the region.
