        It is now well-established that the brine produced by desalination poses a serious environmental challenge,
        threatening marine resources and ecosystems. Stories from fishermen, local communities, and researchers
        interviewed by Muwatin during its investigative series "The Cost of Fresh Water in the Arabian Gulf" highlight
        the scale of this crisis. However, despite its urgency, the issue remains without decisive strategies or
        practical solutions that can be implemented on a large scale.

                Over a year, Muwatin conducted extensive interviews with nearly twenty researchers and scientists
                specializing in desalination technologies, many of whom have spent years working in the six Gulf
                Cooperation Council (GCC) states. The team also participated in key conferences, including the Euromed
                2024 – Desalination for Clean Water and Energy conference, organized by the European Desalination
                Society (EDS) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from May 6 to 9, 2024.
