            Regulatory Framework
        </h5>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            Many researchers interviewed by Muwatin highlighted that while technological changes could resolve the brine
            crisis caused by desalination plants, the lack of strict regulatory frameworks hinders the full potential of
            these solutions. Regulatory tools for managing brine salinity vary between countries based on environmental
            and local conditions. However, there is a notable absence of comprehensive regulations in the Gulf region.

            Dr. Al-Saidi explains: “We need clear and effective standards and mechanisms to monitor their
            implementation. However, looking at the available literature, it’s evident that compliance with such
            standards isn’t always strict. Even in countries like Saudi Arabia, where some standards exist, effective
            monitoring and clear plans for addressing non-compliance are essential. This underscores the need for
            emergency environmental plans and robust monitoring mechanisms, which, unfortunately, are not as common in
            the Gulf as in other parts of the world.”

            Dr. Al-Saidi also reviewed studies that show how environmental regulations can drive technological
            innovation. He notes: “Once desalination plants are required to meet environmental limits and provide
            monitoring plans, it becomes a significant cost factor for them. This incentivizes innovation through new
            technologies or even by extracting and selling minerals from brine. We’ve seen this dynamic in the U.S. and
            other countries, where environmental regulations led to technological advancements.”

            He explains: "In the Gulf, we need to strengthen these environmental systems. However, as policymakers, we
            must recognize that the reality is different. Cities like Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai rely on several
            desalination plants to meet their needs. Therefore, working closely with these plants is possible due to
            their limited number. However, we cannot impose strict environmental regulations if these plants are unable
            to implement them practically."

            A 2023 research paper co-authored by Al-Saidi highlighted six common regulatory approaches worldwide for
            managing brine in a structured manner.
