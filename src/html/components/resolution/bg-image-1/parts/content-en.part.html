    Dr. Mohamed Al-Saidi, an associate professor at the College of Public Policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, tells
    Muwatin:

    I’ve always wondered why the ‘brine crisis’ hasn’t been resolved. Perhaps it’s the cost, but the Gulf states are
    wealthy enough to bear that expense, especially since it’s not a technically complex issue. This became evident when
    newer desalination plants like ‘Umm Al Houl’ were built using less polluting technologies. We monitored these plants
    and found no significant environmental impact because they employed evaporation and dilution to manage brine,
    reducing its harmful effects. However, the real issue lies in the lack of investment in these technologies by
    desalination plants, especially in the Gulf, which houses the world’s largest number of desalination plants.

    Dr. Al-Saidi adds: The biggest challenge is the existing infrastructure. Incorporating new technologies into massive
    plants is difficult without disrupting water supplies. Solutions require gradual intervention and infrastructure
    upgrades, focusing on improving brine dilution techniques.
