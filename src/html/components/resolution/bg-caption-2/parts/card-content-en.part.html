    On a Small Scale
</h5>

<p>
    Four years ago, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in collaboration with Red Sea Global,
    launched a global engineering challenge titled <a href="https://www.redseaglobal.com/en/-/media-center/red-sea-global-and-kaust-launch-the-brains-for-brine-challenge">“Brains for Brine.”</a> The competition sought innovative ideas for brine
    utilization, attracting over 125 submissions. The first-place winner proposed a circular solution to the brine issue
    using technology to create an eco-friendly building material. Another idea involved redirecting brine to the Dead
    Sea, connected to the rift system north of the Gulf of Aqaba.
    The Dead Sea, which is experiencing a severe volume reduction due to water withdrawals from its basin, is
    approximately 470 meters below sea level.
