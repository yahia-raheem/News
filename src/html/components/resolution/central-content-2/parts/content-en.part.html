        The conference was marked by a surge of academic activity, with numerous scientific papers presented in search
        of effective solutions to the brine challenge caused by desalination. Yet, as Muwatin observed and experts
        confirmed, these solutions remain confined mainly to academic studies and have seen limited application in
        small-scale projects.

        Researchers interviewed by Muwatin unanimously agreed that governments are well aware of the "brine crisis" and
        are actively seeking solutions. Carlos Duarte, Professor of Marine Science at King Abdullah University Of
        Science And Technology (KAUST), noted that the current trend in desalination research
        focuses on developing technologies that altogether avoid brine discharge. This approach reflects the growing
        desire to minimize environmental harm while maximizing freshwater extraction efficiency.

        Proposed Solutions
    </h5>

        Based on a 2023 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212371723000252">study</a> published in the journal Water Resources and Industry titled "Governing desalination,
        managing the brine: A review and systematization of regulatory and socio-technical issues," seven proposed
        solutions have been identified to address the brine crisis. These solutions fall under three main categories:

        However, despite the range of options, these solutions face significant real-world challenges, including legal
        constraints, regulatory hurdles, high costs, and limited access to the technology required for implementation.
