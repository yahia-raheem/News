    According to Dr. Le Quesne, the interaction of brine with high temperatures and chemicals has a powerful and
    destructive impact on marine life. It also negatively affects fisheries and biodiversity, with repercussions on
    tourism by damaging certain coastal habitats, which could accelerate coastal erosion.

    Le Quesne further highlights another issue: desalination plants often draw in seawater, which can unintentionally
    capture marine organisms, such as fish larvae, plankton, and other small marine life forms. This can disrupt the
    local marine biodiversity.

    Meanwhile, Hamed Ibrahim, a researcher in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT), who has studied desalination plants in the Arabian Gulf for a decade, confirms to
    Muwatin that brine discharge leads to the proliferation of harmful algal blooms (HABs). These blooms produce toxins
    that can harm marine life and humans. He adds, “These algae cause fish deaths, deplete oxygen, and release harmful
    toxins into the water.”

    In his 2020 study published in the Journal of Environmental Engineering, Ibrahim found that the southern Gulf area
    near the Strait of Hormuz experienced a shift in toxic algal growth between 1980 and 2015. His study links the rapid
    expansion of desalination in the Gulf since the late 1980s to the observed increase in the growth rate and quantity
    of toxic algae in the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

    Ibrahim also points out the harm these toxic algal blooms cause to desalination plants. They clog filters and damage
    equipment, increasing the costs of pre-treating seawater and hindering freshwater production. His study further
    highlights that several desalination plants in the Gulf were shut down due to toxic algal blooms in 2008 and 2009.
