        The brine volume also depends on the recovery rate, with higher recovery rates producing less brine. For
        instance, Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) distillation plants typically have recovery rates ranging from 35% to 45%,
        while reverse osmosis plants can achieve up to 90% recovery rates.

        Dr. Daoud emphasizes that brine discharge from thermal desalination methods, including cooling water, amounts to
        approximately seven cubic meters for every cubic meter of desalinated water produced. In contrast,
        membrane-based methods significantly reduce this volume to one cubic meter of brine for each cubic meter of
        desalinated water.

        Dr. Daoud states, “The salinity caused by brine is not the only issue.” He considers the larger crisis to be the
        presence of chemical additives in the discharged water, which harm marine life. These toxic chemicals prevent
        scaling on boiler walls or manage foam formation when saline water enters the desalination plants.

        Dr. Le Quesne agrees, stating, “We don’t fully know which chemicals are used in desalination plants. Each plant
        might use slightly different types.” However, during his research, Le Quesne and his team found reports
        indicating that anti-scalants are added at concentrations of no more than two milligrams per liter.

        Le Quesne adds, “Some studies have shown that anti-scalants can affect coral reefs and may be toxic.” He
        hypothesizes that if anti-scalants are added at a rate of no more than two milligrams per liter of water
        processed by desalination plants, and this rate is multiplied by the volume of desalinated water, it can be
        estimated that around 13 million kilograms of anti-scalants are discharged into the coastal waters of the Gulf
        annually—equivalent to 500 large trucks worth of anti-scalants dumped into the Gulf’s coastal waters each year.

        Muwatin could not identify the specific types of anti-scalants used, but according to the GWI database, three
        companies supply chemical feed systems to 17 desalination plants in GCC countries. Among them are Statiflo
        International Ltd, a private limited company based in the United Kingdom, and BASF (Badische Anilin- und
        Sodafabrik), a European multinational and the world’s largest chemical producer, which supplies chemical feed
        systems.

        The brine discharged from desalination plants also contains heavy metals such as copper, iron, aluminum, and
        nickel. In a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-016-7961-x" target="_blank">research
            article published in Springer Nature</a>, the researcher analyzed samples taken 1,500 meters away from the
        Al-Khobar desalination plant—one of the oldest and largest reverse osmosis desalination facilities in eastern
        Saudi Arabia. The study found that heavy metal concentrations in the sediments were 10 to 100 times higher than
        the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The researcher concluded that these elevated levels were
        linked to the liquid waste discharges from the desalination plant.

                The recovery rate in desalination plants is a critical performance metric that indicates the efficiency
                of the water purification process. It is defined as the percentage of the total volume of feedwater
                introduced into the system converted into usable freshwater.

                Anti-scalants increase the solubility of sparingly soluble salts and are more commonly used in reverse
                osmosis plants to enhance water permeability.
