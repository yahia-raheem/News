            Process: Seawater is pushed through a semi-permeable membrane under high pressure, allowing only water
            molecules to pass through while rejecting salts and impurities. This method is the most widely used due to
            its efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to thermal methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: Water enters through the intake system, undergoes pre-treatment to remove larger particles, and
            is then pushed through the reverse osmosis membranes. The result is fresh water, while the concentrated
            brine is discarded.

            Process: Osmotic pressure differences are used to draw water through a semi-permeable membrane using a
            concentrated draw solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: Similar steps are followed for intake and pre-treatment, with fresh water produced on one side
            of the membrane.

            Process: Seawater is heated, then rapidly depressurized to produce steam, which is condensed into fresh
            water. This method is energy-intensive but effective for large-scale operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: Seawater enters, is heated, and the steam is collected as fresh water, leaving behind the brine
            after condensation.

            Process: Multiple stages of evaporation and condensation are used, where the steam from one stage heats the
            next stage, improving energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: Similar to traditional desalination methods but with higher heat efficiency.

            Process: Steam generated by boiling seawater is compressed, and the heat released during compression is used
            to evaporate more seawater.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: The fresh water vapor is condensed back into liquid form, while the brine is discarded.

            Process: An electric field drives ions through selective ion-exchange membranes, separating fresh water from
            salty water. This method is more effective for brackish water than seawater.
        </p>
        <p>
            Water Flow: Fresh water exits from one side of the membrane, while the brine accumulates on the other side.
