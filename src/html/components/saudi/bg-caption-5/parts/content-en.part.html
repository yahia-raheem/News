    <h5>Ibrahim’s study highlights that the southwestern region of the Arabian Gulf is the most affected by salinity
        levels caused by brine discharge.
    </h5>
    <p>
        To measure these levels, the researchers developed a high-resolution coupled model to simulate the dynamic
        interaction between brine discharge and its circulation in the Gulf. The model incorporates atmospheric and
        oceanic components to provide a detailed analysis of the Gulf’s conditions.

        The study examined salinity and temperature data from 1981 to 1990, with relatively few desalination plants.
        Using this data, the model simulated scenarios, including one without brine discharge, one involving discharge
        from the 24 largest desalination plants in the Gulf, and another where brine discharge was limited to 14 major
        plants outside the southwestern Gulf.

        The model ran for ten years, and the results revealed that brine discharge raises salinity levels by 1.6 grams
        per kilogram. Salt accumulation is particularly severe in the southwestern region of the Gulf, near the Arabian
        coastline.

        Ibrahim likens the Arabian Gulf to a swimming pool in the middle of an extremely hot desert, where the
        evaporation rate is exceptionally high. The average annual evaporation rate is approximately 1.8 cubic meters
        per year, contributing to the increased salinity caused by excessive evaporation of the freshwater entering the
        Gulf via the Shatt al-Arab from Iraq, leaving behind salts and minerals.
