        Desalination plants, introduced to address water scarcity and human thirst, have had a severe environmental
        impact on marine life in the Gulf. These plants increase the salinity of their waters by discharging brine—a
        byproduct of the desalination process—into the Gulf, and they have also contributed to rising water temperatures
        in the region.

        “It is evident to everyone that the Arabian Gulf hosts an enormous amount of desalinated water, which
        undoubtedly has environmental consequences, both now and in the future,” asserts Dr. Will Le Quesne, Principal
        Marine Environmental Scientist at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)—the UK
        government’s marine science advisory agency. Dr. Le Quesne, who spent seven years in the Arabian Gulf reviewing
        the environmental impact of desalination plants on the Arabian Sea, has published several scientific papers and
        studies on desalinated water, as he explained in his interview with Muwatin.
