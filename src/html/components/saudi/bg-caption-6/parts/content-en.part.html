    <h5>Will it stop?</h5>

        According to our experts, GCC governments don’t intend to halt the construction of new desalination plants. On
        the contrary, the region aims to reach a total desalination capacity of 80 million cubic meters per day by 2050.

        Le Quesne comments, “As new plants are built, contributing to environmental pollution, there is also ongoing and
        intensifying climate change, with temperatures rising dramatically. We can expect compounded impacts on coral
        reefs, fish populations, and marine life in general.”

        A study published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin predicts that salinity and temperature levels in the
        Arabian Gulf will rise significantly by 2050. It forecasts that temperatures in three-quarters of Gulf habitats
        with depths of less than 20 meters will increase by more than 2°C (3.6°F).

        “The impact of desalination plants is silent, but if given another decade, it will explode,” warns Lionel Rabin,
        founder and CEO of HALTIQA, a company dedicated to sustainable desalinated water solutions. From a coastal
        village in France, Rabin tells Muwatin: “Fish will disappear from smaller areas because high salinity levels
        will push some species to migrate. Along with them, fishermen will leave their traditional livelihoods, forcing
        them to reinvent themselves in other jobs to support their families.”
