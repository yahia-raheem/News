                These submerged pipelines produced approximately 135 cubic meters of desalinated water daily.

            <p class="mb-3">However, in 1928, the system was replaced by another developed by a Scottish company.
                Abdulaziz Al Saud, the future founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, initiated this change just three
                years after his conquest of the Hijaz region. These efforts marked the foundational steps in localizing
                desalination technology across the water-scarce emirates and kingdoms of the Gulf.

                Over the course of the 20th century, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries steadily advanced their
                reliance on this groundbreaking desalination technology to meet their growing water needs. This effort
                was driven by the population boom resulting from rising birth rates and the influx of foreign workers
                drawn to the region by the economic boom following the discovery of oil.

            In the 1950s and 1960s, Kuwait took the lead in adapting desalination technology, establishing the first
            modern plant utilizing Multi-Stage Flash Distillation (MSF). Soon after, other Gulf Cooperation Council
            (GCC) countries followed suit. Bahrain and Oman launched their first plants in 1975, with the United Arab
            Emirates joining in 1977.

            New desalination technologies have since continued to emerge. As of October 2023, 815 GCC countries
            desalination plants rely on Arabian Gulf water. According to data from <a
                href="https://www.globalwaterintel.com/">Global water intelligence,</a> these facilities comprise 1,668
            seawater-fed desalination plants spread across the region.
