        Dr. Will Le Quesne illustrates the gravity of the issue by comparing the amount of desalinated water produced
        daily in 2018 to Olympic swimming pools. He explains that the daily volume of desalinated water could fill 8,200
        Olympic-sized swimming pools. “If these pools were lined up in a single row, they would form a swimming pool 410
        kilometers long—half the distance between Kuwait and Abu Dhabi,” he adds.

        Le Quesne then expands on this example, noting, “The volume of water processed by desalination plants is three
        times the amount extracted as freshwater. These plants withdraw seawater, extract the freshwater, and discharge
        the brine back into the sea. Therefore, the volume of water processed daily in 2018 would suffice to create a
        line of swimming pools stretching from Kuwait to Abu Dhabi and halfway back.”
