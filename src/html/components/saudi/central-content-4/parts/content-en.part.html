        According to Dr. Mohamed Daoud, a water resources consultant at the Environment Agency in Abu Dhabi, the
        salinity concentration in brine discharged from desalination plants ranges between 50 and 75 milligrams per
        liter, and it is much denser than seawater. This causes the brine to settle at the seabed near the discharge
        outlet, creating a highly saline layer of water. This layer negatively impacts the environment and marine life,
        particularly in areas with low water circulation, slow currents, or shallow depths.

        In his interview with Muwatin, Dr. Daoud also explained that the temperature of the discharged brine is
        elevated, typically up to five degrees Celsius higher than the surrounding seawater. This increase raises the
        temperature of the coastal water, reduces oxygen levels, and can lead to the formation of “dead zones”—areas
        devoid of biological activity. The brine is also more toxic due to the chemicals used in the desalination
        process.

        Detailed data on the volume of brine produced by desalination plants is lacking, and scientific studies vary in
        their estimates of the volume discharged into the Arabian Gulf. A 2020 paper published in Environmental Research
        Communications notes that the largest 24 desalination plants in the Arabian Gulf in 2017, producing
        approximately 11 million cubic meters of freshwater daily, discharged about 275,000 cubic meters of salt into
        the Gulf daily. Over a five-year period, this could increase the basin-wide salinity by about 0.2 psi.

        However, another study published in April 2018 estimates that for every cubic meter of freshwater produced in
        GCC countries, two cubic meters of brine are discharged into the Gulf.

        Dr. Daoud highlights that the brine discharge volume also depends on the plant’s production capacity and used
        technology.
