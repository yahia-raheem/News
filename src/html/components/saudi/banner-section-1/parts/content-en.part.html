        <p class="animate fade-in">The inhabitants of the vast desert region nestled between a sea and a gulf faced a
            pressing challenge: an arid climate and scarce water resources. Finding a solution wasn’t a luxury—it was a
            necessity.

        <p class="animate fade-in">The answer lay in the sea's salty waters, transformed into drinkable water through
            submerged pipelines connected to desalination units. According to a 2014 report by the General Secretariat
            of the Gulf Cooperation Council, this transformative technology was first introduced to the region by a
            Dutch company. In the city of Jeddah, locals called it “Kindasa,” a colloquial twist on the English word
            “Condenser.”
