    Five years after Le Quesne’s analysis, by October 2023, data from the Global Water Intelligence (GWI) database—which
    includes operational, decommissioned, and planned plants—reveal that the total desalination capacity in GCC
    countries drawing water from the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian Sea has nearly doubled. The capacity now stands at
    approximately 46 million cubic meters per day, equivalent to 14,832 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

        According to the Global Water Intelligence (GWI) database, half is allocated for drinking purposes. Over a third
        (37%) is used for industrial purposes, while the remaining portion is distributed between irrigation and
        tourism.
