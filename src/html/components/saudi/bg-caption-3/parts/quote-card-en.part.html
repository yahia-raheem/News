        The Brine Discharge
    </h5>
    <p>
        The operation of desalination plants varies depending on the technology used; some rely on high temperatures,
        while others utilize membranes. However, desalination plants fundamentally work by removing salt and impurities
        from seawater to produce freshwater suitable for drinking. The process involves several key stages, including
        pumping seawater into the plant, filtering it to remove larger particles, and forcing the filtered seawater
        through semi-permeable membranes under high pressure. These membranes contain tiny pores that allow water
        molecules to pass through while retaining salt. The treated water is then purified and filtered again to meet
        drinking water standards. Finally, the remaining saline water, known as brine or saline reject, is discharged
        back into the sea. This brine discharge is the primary environmental concern associated with desalination
        plants, leading to increased salinity in the marine environment.
