    <h5>An Enormous Capacity</h5>
    <p>
        Desalination plants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have a capacity of 67 million cubic meters
        per day, representing 45% of the total global capacity of seawater-based desalination plants across 187
        countries. Meanwhile, desalination plants in the GCC that rely on water from the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian
        Sea account for 31% of the worldâ€™s desalination capacity.

    <p>
        The Arabian/Persian Gulf, shared by the GCC states and Iraq on one side and Iran on the other, is a
        semi-enclosed sea connected to the Arabian Sea via the Strait of Hormuz. This narrow and strategic waterway
        forms the only link between the Gulf and the open waters of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. This
        geographic connection has facilitated the exchange of water, marine life, and other resources between the Gulf
        and the Arabian Sea.
