    Most researchers who spoke to Muwatin agree that the environmental crisis caused by desalination plants is not
    limited to a specific country, but rather a regional issue shared to varying degrees among the six GCC states. Its
    impact is unevenly distributed across the region, depending on geographical factors.

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Professor Anton Purnama from Sultan Qaboos University in Oman explained to Muwatin that the environmental impact
    depends largely on the depth of the sea and the circulation of water in the Arabian Gulf.

    He added, “It’s unfair that the biggest polluters—Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—don’t experience the
    same environmental consequences as countries like Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, where Gulf waters are shallower.”

    According to the GWI database, the United Arab Emirates has the largest desalination capacity in the Arabian Gulf
    region, accounting for 36% of the total capacity of GCC desalination plants. It is followed by Saudi Arabia at 29%,
    Kuwait at 13%, Qatar at 10%, Oman at 8%, and Bahrain at 4%.
