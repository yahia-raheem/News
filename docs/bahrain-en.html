    For 64 of his nearly 80 years, Bahraini fisherman Sayed Jaafar Al-Bladi worked the waters of the Arabian Gulf. This
    work was a lifeline for him, his children, and his grandchildren. However, changes in these waters have forced him
    to abandon the only livelihood he has ever known.
</p>
<p class="animate fade-in content">
    Al-Bladi, like more than half of Bahrain’s population, lives on the shores of the Arabian Gulf. He knows its waters
    as intimately as he knows himself. “In the late 1980s, the sea began to change because of the construction of
    desalination plants,” he says.

    He describes the transformation to Muwatin: “At first, we saw pipes pumping water into the sea. They told us it was
    for desalinating Gulf water to make it suitable for drinking, farming, and other uses. But things escalated. The
    Gulf’s waters changed color, and its smell became unbearable. It turned yellow. The fish we relied on for our
    livelihood fled these waters.”
</p>
<p class="content">
    He adds, “When we noticed the changes in the water, we raised the issue with officials, who assured us it was a
    temporary problem that would be resolved quickly. But today, the damage has reached every Bahraini coastline. Fish,
    which are both a key source of food security for Bahrain’s population and a vital part of our local culture, are now
    almost nonexistent. Our fisheries cannot compare to those of other Gulf or Arab countries anymore.”

    <p>Experts and researchers interviewed by Muwatin and published scientific studies point to the “Al Dur 1” and “Al
        Dur 2” plants as contributors to increased salinity in Bahrain’s waters in the Arabian Gulf. The discharge of
        brine into shallow depths has negatively impacted benthic (seafloor) animals, seagrass beds, and, consequently,
        the livelihoods of local fishermen in the area.</p>

                The “Al Dur 1” desalination plant is located on Bahrain’s southeastern coast and officially entered full
                operation in February 2012 to meet the growing demand for drinking water and electricity. It has a daily
                capacity of 218,000 cubic meters (58 million gallons) were developed as a Build-Own-Operate (BOO)
                project with private sector participation.

                In March 2019, seven years after “Al Dur 1” began operations, an agreement was signed to launch a new
                plant, “Al Dur 2.” Spanning over 192,000 square meters, the new facility was designed to generate 1,500
                megawatts of power using combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technology and to desalinate 58 million
                gallons of seawater daily through reverse osmosis—a technology also employed by “Al Dur 1.” The plant
                entered full operation in the second quarter of 2022.

<p>A 2019 <a href="https://wstagcc.org/WSTA-13th-Gulf-Water-Conference/WSTA-13-Gulf-Water-Conference-Proceedings%20.pdf"
        target="_blank">study</a> titled “Effect of brine discharge from Al-Dur RO [Reverse Osmosis] desalination plant
    on the infauna species composition in the East Coast of Bahrain” revealed that brine discharge from the “Al Dur”
    desalination plant has created harsh environmental conditions.
</p>
<p>The researchers collected water samples from ten locations, varying in distance from the plant’s discharge outlet and
    at depths ranging from less than one meter to seven meters. They measured salinity and tidal movements, finding that
    water salinity exceeded 55% near the plant’s discharge point. This is significantly higher than the natural seawater
    salinity of about 35%, posing a severe threat to local Fmarine ecosystems. Additionally, water temperatures near the
    discharge site exceeded 38°C (100.4°F), particularly during summer, indicating a notable thermal impact.
</p>
<p>The study also documented a decline in biodiversity and the abundance of benthic (seafloor) microfaunal communities
    in areas adjacent to the desalination plant’s discharge point. Fish mortality and the disappearance of benthic
    marine species, such as echinoderms, were observed around the plant. These effects were attributed to slow growth
    rates, failures in osmoregulatory mechanisms, cell shrinkage, and endocrine dysfunction.

        In Bahrain, where salinity gradient standards are absent, the study compared its findings with the quality
        standards set by Kuwait’s Environmental Public Authority for cooling water discharge into marine areas. The
        comparison showed that salinity levels at most sampling sites exceeded the permissible wastewater discharge
        standards by an average of 2.5%- 9.0%.

        Al-Bladi corroborates this: “Many fish that were once abundant and even exported from Bahrain have disappeared.
        One example is the ‘mied’ fish, plentiful until 2002. It was so abundant that children could catch it along the
        shores. Back then, its price didn’t exceed half a dinar per kilogram because it was easy to catch, as it swam
        near the surface, unlike other species that required diving. Now, it’s gone. Another species, ‘Safi,’

        In the past, Al-Bladi used to catch around 40 kilograms of fish daily. Now, his nets rarely yield more than

    Dr. Thamer Al-Daoud, a professor of marine biology in the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at the
    Arabian Gulf University, explains the impact of salinity in his interview with Muwatin. He says, “The effects of
    excessive salinity on marine organisms are often physiological. Coastal species are adapted to a process known as
    ‘osmoregulation,’ where marine organisms match the salt concentration inside their bodies to the salt concentration
    outside. Under normal conditions, marine creatures can regulate osmosis. However, in cases of extreme salinity,
    these organisms either migrate to distant areas or die because they cannot withstand the stress.”

    <h5>Osmoregulation:</h5>
    <p>Osmoregulation is the active process by which living organisms maintain the balance of water and dissolved
        substances within their body fluids to achieve internal equilibrium. This involves regulating osmotic pressure,
        which refers to the tendency of water to move across a semi-permeable membrane due to differences in solute
        concentrations. The primary goal of osmoregulation is to ensure that the internal environment remains stable
        despite changes in external conditions.</p>

    Dr. Al-Daoud adds, “The same applies to extreme temperatures. Marine organisms cannot regulate their body
    temperatures, leading to their death. While some species with wider tolerance ranges can endure elevated
    temperatures and salinity to some extent, they are still affected. Their growth and reproduction rates are no longer
    normal.”
</p>
<p>
    Jawad Al-Qallaf, a Bahraini fisherman in his 50s, has noticed a decline in fish growth rates. He says, “The
    ‘Sobaiti’ fish is now small in size and almost extinct; we can no longer catch it easily. Similarly, the ‘Shaari’
    fish has shrunk and become harder to catch because it has moved to deeper waters.”
</p>

<p>
    Speaking to Muwatin, Al-Qallaf continues, “The Hamour fish has also changed; it’s smaller than what we used to catch
    in the past, even though it’s still abundant. I’ve also noticed a scarcity of other species, like the ‘Qarqofan’ and
    ‘Baddah’ fish. As for the ‘Safat’ fish, it has become rare and is often scrawny. Sometimes, I throw it back into the
    water. The ‘Faskar’ fish has completely disappeared from our waters.”
</p>

<p>
    Dr. Al-Daoud describes the actions of the Al Dur plant as selfish: “The plant draws water from a distance of 1.5
    kilometers (about one mile) to maintain its efficiency, but it discharges the brine directly onto the coast, without
    concern for marine life, its death, or the alteration of the water’s hydraulic properties.”

    Dr. Waleed Zubari, a professor of water resource management at the Arabian Gulf University, chair of the Scientific
    Committee of the Water Science and Technology Association, and supervisor of the study above, tells Muwatin: “The
    Arabian Gulf is shallow, with a depth of no more than 10 meters, and it is a closed, not open, water body. This
    makes it highly susceptible to salinity caused by desalination plants.” Zubari confirms that they identified hot
    spots heavily affected by salinity within a 200-300-meter radius around the plant.
</p>
<p class="animate fade-in">
    He adds, “There is a delicate food chain. We studied the micro-benthic communities and found them missing in areas
    where brine is discharged. These micro-communities are essential because larger fish feed on them. Without them, the
    larger fish will also disappear. This was confirmed when we spoke to fishermen working in the area.”
</p>
<p class="animate fade-in">
    Al-Daoud and Zubari agree that the decline in fish stocks cannot be attributed solely to the salinity and heat
    caused by desalination plants. They emphasize that the causes are interconnected and complex, stemming from various
    pollution sources in the Arabian Gulf, such as oil spills, chemical factory emissions, overfishing, and other
    factors.

    Bahrain’s territorial waters are home to diverse sensitive marine habitats, including seagrass beds, coral reefs,
    mangroves, and intertidal mudflats. These ecosystems play a crucial role in supporting marine biodiversity. They
    serve as nurseries, breeding grounds, and feeding areas for numerous fish species and large endangered animals, such
    as dugongs, dolphins, and green turtles.

    <h5>Seagrass beds:</h5>
    <p>
        Seagrass beds are located near the coast of Al Dur, close to the desalination plant, and extend to the Hawar
        Islands. These habitats are vital for various marine species, providing food and shelter for fish, mollusks, and
        endangered species such as dugongs and green turtles.

        <p class="animate fade-in">Abdulhussein Hassan, a diver in his 50s, has witnessed the changes happening on the seabed
    for decades. He began his career in the early 1980s when he was just 12 years old. Over the past four decades,
    Hassan has observed how the waters of the Arabian Gulf—where he has dived extensively—have deteriorated due to
    desalination plants.</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    “Desalination plants have significantly increased the salinity of the sea, not just in Bahrain but across the Gulf,”
    says Hassan. “Bahrain might be less affected compared to Kuwait, where I worked for many years, but the salinity
    keeps rising day by day. In the past, our ancestors could swim without any harm to their bodies. Today, simply
    entering the water without specialized swimming or diving goggles irritates the eyes and damages the skin.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Hassan recalls seeing hundreds of coral reefs stretching as far as the eye could see, with various colors and
    shapes. Today, however, none remain. “One of the most affected coral species in Bahrain is ‘Arshan,’ which grows
    like a tree and is known for its slow growth,” Hassan tells Muwatin. “There are also stony corals that resemble the
    shape of a human brain, which have been heavily damaged.”
</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Hassan’s observation about the coral reefs is supported by a 2022 <a
        href="https://wstagcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vol_263_-Conference-Proceedings.pdf"
        target="_blank">study</a> titled “Characterization of the water mass dynamic changes surrounding a seawater
    reverse osmosis desalination plant on the east coast of the Kingdom of Bahrain.” The study highlights that the Al
    Dur desalination plant, with its highly saline brine discharge, is situated next to a seagrass habitat stretching
    from eastern Bahrain through Fasht Al Adm to the Hawar Islands. It notes that seagrass growth decreases at
    temperatures above 37°C (98.6°F), with prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) being lethal. This
    suggests that brine discharge zones are likely inhospitable environments for seagrass during the summer months.
</p>
<p class="animate fade-in">
    Environmental impact assessments further indicate that salinity levels above 58% hinder seagrass growth in the
    Arabian Gulf, while levels exceeding 67% render the area unsuitable for any seagrass species. The study also
    reported extreme salinity levels near the discharge points, with a tendency for high concentrations at the seabed,
    potentially stunting the growth of associated seagrass.
</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Dr. Samer Al-Daoud explains the interconnected relationship between seagrass, coral reefs, and mangroves: “If the
    balance of one is disturbed, it affects the others. Mangroves act as a barrier against storms from the land,
    protecting the coastal environment. Seagrass stabilizes the seabed, and if that balance shifts, sediment will
    settle, impacting coral reefs.” He adds, “Seagrass is the most sensitive to salinity and temperature, making it the
    most affected by desalination plants.”
</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    According to a 2022 <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359106240_Assessing_the_spatiotemporal_changes_associated_carbon_stock_and_potential_emissions_of_mangroves_in_Bahrain_using_GIS_and_remote_sensing_data"
        target="_blank">study</a>, Bahrain lost over 95% of its natural mangrove cover between 1967 and 2020, shrinking
    from 328 hectares to just 48 hectares due to urban development and rising sea temperatures.
</p>

<p class="animate fade-in">
    Defending desalination technology, Dr. Waleed Zubari states, “It is essential because Gulf countries are located in
    an arid region, and with growing populations, water must be provided. Access to water is a human right.
    Environmental impacts are often very localized, and new plants are designed to discharge brine at greater depths to
    mitigate their ecological effects.”
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container footer d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-center">
        <p class="animate fade-in">
    As the scientific debate over desalination’s impact continues, fishermen like Al-Bladi and Al-Qallaf face empty
    nets. The Gulf, which once provided them with abundance, is no longer the same. Its waters, struggling against
    salinity and rising temperatures, are driving fish to migrate in search of safer havens, away from certain death.
