        It is now well-established that the brine produced by desalination poses a serious environmental challenge,
        threatening marine resources and ecosystems. Stories from fishermen, local communities, and researchers
        interviewed by Muwatin during its investigative series "The Cost of Fresh Water in the Arabian Gulf" highlight
        the scale of this crisis. However, despite its urgency, the issue remains without decisive strategies or
        practical solutions that can be implemented on a large scale.

            <p class="animate fade-in d-start">
                Over a year, Muwatin conducted extensive interviews with nearly twenty researchers and scientists
                specializing in desalination technologies, many of whom have spent years working in the six Gulf
                Cooperation Council (GCC) states. The team also participated in key conferences, including the Euromed
                2024 – Desalination for Clean Water and Energy conference, organized by the European Desalination
                Society (EDS) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from May 6 to 9, 2024.

        The conference was marked by a surge of academic activity, with numerous scientific papers presented in search
        of effective solutions to the brine challenge caused by desalination. Yet, as Muwatin observed and experts
        confirmed, these solutions remain confined mainly to academic studies and have seen limited application in
        small-scale projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers interviewed by Muwatin unanimously agreed that governments are well aware of the "brine crisis" and
        are actively seeking solutions. Carlos Duarte, Professor of Marine Science at King Abdullah University Of
        Science And Technology (KAUST), noted that the current trend in desalination research
        focuses on developing technologies that altogether avoid brine discharge. This approach reflects the growing
        desire to minimize environmental harm while maximizing freshwater extraction efficiency.

        Proposed Solutions

    <p class="animate fade-in">
        Based on a database compiled by Muwatin through interviews with researchers and scientists, as well as a 2023
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212371723000252">study</a> published in the journal
        Water Resources and Industry titled "Governing desalination, managing the brine:
        A review and systematization of regulatory and socio-technical issues," seven proposed solutions have been
        identified to address the brine crisis. These solutions fall under three main categories:

    Dr. Mohamed Al-Saidi, an associate professor at the College of Public Policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, tells
    Muwatin:
</h5>
<p>
    I’ve always wondered why the ‘brine crisis’ hasn’t been resolved. Perhaps it’s the cost, but the Gulf states are
    wealthy enough to bear that expense, especially since it’s not a technically complex issue. This became evident when
    newer desalination plants like ‘Umm Al Houl’ were built using less polluting technologies. We monitored these plants
    and found no significant environmental impact because they employed evaporation and dilution to manage brine,
    reducing its harmful effects. However, the real issue lies in the lack of investment in these technologies by
    desalination plants, especially in the Gulf, which houses the world’s largest number of desalination plants.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Al-Saidi adds: The biggest challenge is the existing infrastructure. Incorporating new technologies into massive
    plants is difficult without disrupting water supplies. Solutions require gradual intervention and infrastructure
    upgrades, focusing on improving brine dilution techniques.

                    scale in countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, economic and political challenges make short-term
                    solutions difficult. There’s also a pressing need for better policies to ensure the sustainability
                    of water supplies.”

                    water demand.

            Regulatory Framework
        </h5>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            Many researchers interviewed by Muwatin highlighted that while technological changes could resolve the brine
            crisis caused by desalination plants, the lack of strict regulatory frameworks hinders the full potential of
            these solutions. Regulatory tools for managing brine salinity vary between countries based on environmental
            and local conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            Dr. Al-Saidi explains: “We need clear and effective standards and mechanisms to monitor their
            implementation. However, looking at the available literature, it’s evident that compliance with such
            standards isn’t always strict. Even in countries like Saudi Arabia, where some standards exist, effective
            monitoring and clear plans for addressing non-compliance are essential. This underscores the need for
            emergency environmental plans and robust monitoring mechanisms, which, unfortunately, are not as common in
            the Gulf as in other parts of the world.”
        </p>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            Dr. Al-Saidi also reviewed studies that show how environmental regulations can drive technological
            innovation. He notes: “Once desalination plants are required to meet environmental limits and provide
            monitoring plans, it becomes a significant cost factor for them. This incentivizes innovation through new
            technologies or even by extracting and selling minerals from brine. We’ve seen this dynamic in the U.S. and
            other countries, where environmental regulations led to technological advancements.”
        </p>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            He explains: "In the Gulf, we need to strengthen these environmental systems. However, as policymakers, we
            must recognize that the reality is different. Cities like Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai rely on several
            desalination plants to meet their needs. Therefore, working closely with these plants is possible due to
            their limited number. However, we cannot impose strict environmental regulations if these plants are unable
            to implement them practically."
        </p>
        <p class="animate fade-in">
            A 2023 research paper co-authored by Al-Saidi highlighted six common regulatory approaches worldwide for
            managing brine in a structured manner.

            Dr. Al-Saidi stresses the importance of remembering that laws and regulations are meaningless without an effective enforcement mechanism.

This approach should include not only production but also reuse and storage. Through such a gradual strategy, desalination plants can be encouraged to enhance their environmental sustainability without disrupting operations or imposing sudden burdens.

    On a Small Scale
</h5>

<p>
    Four years ago, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in collaboration with Red Sea Global,
    launched a global engineering challenge titled <a href="https://www.redseaglobal.com/en/-/media-center/red-sea-global-and-kaust-launch-the-brains-for-brine-challenge">“Brains for Brine.”</a> The competition sought innovative ideas for brine
    utilization, attracting over 125 submissions. The first-place winner proposed a circular solution to the brine issue
    using technology to create an eco-friendly building material. Another idea involved redirecting brine to the Dead
    Sea, connected to the rift system north of the Gulf of Aqaba.
    The Dead Sea, which is experiencing a severe volume reduction due to water withdrawals from its basin, is
    approximately 470 meters below sea level.

        <p class="dead-sea-revival-para">Carlos Duarte notes that adding brine, with a salinity level of 250 grams of
            salt per liter of water, could help replenish the Dead Sea’s volume. The elevation difference would allow
            gravity to transport brine effectively. While geopolitical challenges complicate such a solution, Duarte
            highlights its technical feasibility and potential benefits.

    Duarte adds, “Other solutions focus on extracting valuable minerals from brine, including gold, silver, and lithium.
    KAUST is advancing lithium extraction technologies, which could hold significant economic value given the rising
    demand for electric vehicle batteries. However, such initiatives address only a fraction of the total brine
    production.”

            Carlos Duarte explains: “The primary goal of desalination is to obtain freshwater as the main product.
            Seawater extracted in the Arabian Peninsula contains about 40 grams of salts per liter, while discharged
            brine concentrations range between 70 and 80 grams per liter. This means that for every liter of seawater
            pumped, 960 grams of desalinated water and the discharged brine contain 920 grams. Accordingly, only 40
            grams of freshwater are extracted from every liter of seawater.”
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    He adds: “If all the salts in seawater could be utilized, it would allow the extraction of all the freshwater
    associated with them. This would reduce the volume of seawater that needs to be pumped and mitigate the risks of
    returning brine to the ocean.”
</p>
<p class="last-para">
    Duarte emphasizes that researching ways to use brine as a raw resource would bring significant benefits, especially
    for Gulf countries, which produce more than half of the world’s desalinated water. This poses a significant
    challenge in terms of energy consumption in the region.
